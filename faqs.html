        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">FAQs:</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">What's the difference between the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S?</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            With the help of the Xbox Velocity Architecture, both systems provide next-generation features like quicker loading times, smoother and more dynamic worlds, frame rates of up to 120 frames per second, and the option to transition between games with Quick Resume.
            The Xbox Series X has a UHD Blu-ray Disc player, 1 TB or 2 TB of proprietary SSD storage, and native 4K game display. These are the main differences between the two consoles. There is also a digital-only variant of this console that does not have a disc player. With a 512 GB or 1 TB custom SSD, the Xbox Series S is made for disc-free gaming at 1440p (with the option to upgrade to 4K).
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">How can I transfer my games from my current console to Xbox Series X|S?</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            You can transfer your games from another Xbox device via an existing USB 3.1+ external hard drive to use on Xbox Series X|S. You can play Xbox One, Xbox 360, and original Xbox games directly from the external USB HDD.
            You can also use the network transfer function by following these steps:
            Press the Xbox button to open the guide, and then go to Profile & system > Settings > System > Backup & transfer > Network transfer.
            Enable Network transfer for both your current Xbox One and your new Xbox Series X|S to be able to use the feature.
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">How does next-gen gameplay differ between Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S?</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Although developers are ultimately in charge of figuring out how games best utilize the two consoles' technical capabilities, 
            players usually view resolution as the primary distinction between the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">How can I ensure that my Xbox Series X|S is well-ventilated?</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Xbox Series X|S consoles release all heat produced while in use, just like any other electronic device. During development, the Xbox team concentrated on cooling the Xbox Series X|S and created the Parallel Cooling Architecture. The system is operating as planned and in accordance with our expectations if you notice some warm air coming from the exhaust ports.
            We advise positioning the unit in an open space with clear access to the top and rear inlets and outputs to guarantee your device is getting the best air flow possible. We advise positioning the device in an open area (such a small cabinet) if you're using it in an entertainment set. If at all feasible, avoid putting it behind a closed door.
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;"> How much space is available on the SSD?</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Xbox Series X is available in 1 TB and 2 TB versions. As is typical with consoles, we've reserved space for system files and dedicated a portion for Quick Resume, a new technology made possible by our Xbox Velocity Architecture.</p>
